title: "My first but not last React/Redux project"

This last 10+ months have been incredible, from having an vague understand of the topics the teach at Flatiron School to be able to build fullstack applications with in less than 1 year is a great feeling. I’ve found something that I love, something that is extremely rewarding but also challenging.  

I wanted to build something useful this time, we just introduced an physical library at my work, but wouldn’t it better to have an digital version? To be able to keep track of who’s currently reading a book? And to know what books we do have in the library without having to actually go there to find out. 

This idea took longer than I expected, mainly though things out of my control, interruptions in my regular schedule made it hard to keep a consistent phase to finish this project in the time I was hoping for. Not doing enough upfront planing was another reason why it took longer than expected. The last section in the curriculum made you use almost everything we’ve learned and it was easy to miss some crucial parts a long the way. 

Something that would have speeded up the development for me was to incorporate the AMS ActiveModel Serializer a lot earlier in the process, this helped me establish db relationships within my API. My first instinct to tackle this was do pair the JSON objects within my reducer, something that did end up working but it also made my reducers very heavy and also in the end it made them manipulate the data coming from my API, something I wanted to prevent. Instead I installed the AMS gem which made it easy to re-create the db relationships and render JSON objects with their respective object.

I feel like I’ve scratched the surface when it comes to React and Redux and it’s an exciting time to be able to build with these tools, you find new tips and tricks of doing things everyday. I’m now going to continue my journey outside Flatiron School, continue building and learning on my own, and by the next year I really hope coming back to this post realizing that I’ve taken an even bigger step into the world of web development.
