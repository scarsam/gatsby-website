title: "Why did I decide to learn software development?"
---

So it all started 2012. I decided to move from Stockholm, Sweden
to San Francisco to pursue a bachelor degree in Web Design & New Media.
A program covering everything from graphic design to font-making and
some basic web design classes writing HTML/CSS. At that moment I
realized that coding was something I wanted to become better at.
At this time my knowledge of coding was nothing more than a few simple websites.
After my graduation I was fortune to interview at a startup in San Francisco
at the time called ZenPayroll (today Gusto).

After a few rounds of interviews I was getting an job offer to join the design team as the third designer.
Working at a startup has been great, I got to do a variety of different things
but always felt that the coding was the most rewarding part of my job.
Fast forward 2.5 years, I’m still at Gusto as part of the growth team,
I’ve had the opportunity to work around amazing people that have
inspired me and showed me what’s possible.

The reason why I decided to apply
to Flatiron School was to be able to learn software development and
bridge the gap between design and software. But also being able to take
ideas and designs and put them into reality.
