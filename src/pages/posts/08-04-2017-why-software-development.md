title: "Why did I decide to learn software development?"
---

So it all started 2012 when I decided to move from hometown Stockholm to San Francisco to pursue a bachelor degree in Web Design & New Media. A program covering everything from graphic design to font-making and some basic web design classes coding simple restaurant websites and such. After a few semester taking a bunch of different classes, I realized that the web design classes was the ones I was looking forward to the most. At this time my knowledge of coding was nothing more than a few simple websites. After my graduation I started looking opportunities at companies were I was able to both design and code. After some phone interviews with different companies I was fortune to get in contact with ZenPayroll (today Gusto).

After a few rounds of on-site interviews I was getting an job offer to join the design team as their third designer. Working at a startup has been great, I got to do a variety of different things but always felt that the coding was the most rewarding part of my job. Fast forward 2.5 years, I’m still at Gusto but now part of our growth team, I’ve had the opportunity to work around amazing people and today I worked closely with my teams product manager and our engineers to deliver design.  Working closely with the engineers on my team have inspired me to learn more about software development. To be able to create software that helps people and the feeling that nothing is impossible is so reward!

The reason why I decided to apply to Flatiron School was to be able to learn software development and bridge the gap between design and software. But also being able to take ideas and designs and put them into reality. To not be able to take my designs and ideas into reality is something that have also been a great motivation for me to learn software development.
