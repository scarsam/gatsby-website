So this year is coming to and end, and I’m looking back on what I’ve achieved my first 6 months at Flatiron School. So far I’ve finished 472 labs, I’ve finished 2 of the 5 big projects and just about to start on my third. I published my first gem which received over 1000 downloads. I’ve learned a lot of about Ruby, a language I had no experience in before. I’ve learned about object orientation and how to persist actions do a database. My goal to put in 20 hours/week have been though, and I would mostly say that I’ve been missing that with a few hours. But these last 2 weeks have been great and I’ve been able to put in about 20-24 hours a week! 

Flatiron School has been great so far but there also have been a lot of challenges. Some of the biggest ones is defiantly around object association, nested forms. I’m planing on doing a blog post about them and also reviewing the labs for that once again. I will now take a few days of to enjoy the holidays and do some traveling but I’m looking forward to start coding again in 2018, first up I have my rails project which I need to plan and then I will start moving on to the Javascript section. 

2018 will also be the year I’m finishing up the bootcamp and I’m looking forward to see what these new skills can take me in my careers. My goal will be to find a more technical role at work so I can start using my coding skills and also start expanding my knowledge even more from all my great engineering co-workers. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
